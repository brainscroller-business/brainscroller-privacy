# BrainScroller — Privacy Policy
**Last updated:** October 1, 2025

Welcome to **BrainScroller** (“we”, “our”, “us”). We care about your privacy. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.  
Questions? **brainscroller@gmail.com**

## What we collect

### Information you provide
- Account details (e.g., email) when you sign in or contact support.
- In-app preferences (e.g., settings, completed items).

### Information collected automatically
- **Usage data**: screens, taps, session length, crash logs.
- **Device data**: model, OS, language, country/region, time zone, IP-derived region.
- **Advertising identifiers** (e.g., Google Advertising ID) for ads and measurement.
- **Push tokens** to deliver notifications to your device.

### Microphone (optional)
If you enable the **voice feature**, the app accesses the microphone while you use that feature. We do **not** record or listen in the background. Audio is used only to fulfill your request and is not collected otherwise.

### Purchases (optional)
If you buy subscriptions or features, we receive non-sensitive purchase metadata (product ID, status, timestamps). We do **not** receive full payment details.

## How we use information
- Provide, maintain, and improve app features and performance.
- Personalize content and measure feature effectiveness.
- Show ads and limit ad frequency.
- Send push notifications you opt into (reminders, new content).
- Prevent fraud, secure our services, and comply with law.
- Provide support and respond to requests.

## Third-party services (processors)
We use trusted vendors to operate the app; they process data on our behalf under contract:

- **Supabase** — authentication, database, storage, sessions.  
- **Amplitude** — product analytics.  
- **Google AdMob** — ads, measurement, fraud prevention (may receive device/ad IDs and coarse location signals).  
- **Expo Notifications** — delivery of push notifications.  
- **RevenueCat** *(if enabled)* — subscription & purchase management.

These providers may process data on servers in various countries consistent with their own privacy commitments.

## Ads & tracking choices
- **Personalized ads**: opt out in device settings (Google settings → Ads).  
- **Analytics**: we use aggregated analytics to improve the product.  
- **Do Not Sell**: we **do not sell** personal information.

## Push notifications
We send notifications only if you allow them. Turn them off anytime in system settings or in-app (if available).

- Crash/diagnostic data: retained for operational periods, then aggregated or deleted.  
- Purchase records: retained as required for accounting and anti-fraud.  
- Notification tokens: deleted on logout, disablement, or after reasonable inactivity.
